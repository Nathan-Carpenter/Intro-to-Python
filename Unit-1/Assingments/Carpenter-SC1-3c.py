#this code has 2 functions, f() and g(). f() doubles the input and g() lists the length of the input. This assingment asks to assign a variable x to be equal to f(8) and to print that, and to do the same with y for gh:('dolphin'), amd z for f(g('elephant'))




def f(a):
	a = int(a)
	b = a*2
	
	return b
	#end of f()
	

def g(c):
	d = len(c)
	
	return d
	#end of g()
