#for loop 1

#WHILE loops repead until some condition is met (you dont know how many times it will do)

#For loops repeat an EXACT number of times (You do know how many times it will do)

#UNLIKE other languages, FOR loops in python are desinged to lloop over a COLLECTION OF ITEMS (lists, dictionaries, range(), objects)

#THREE major uses

#1 analyzing LETTERS in a STRING
word = 'horsefeathers'

##for each in word:
	#each will be 'h'
	#print('the letter is',each)
	#print('the letter',each,'shows up',word.count(each),'lines')
	
	

#2 analyzing OBJECTS in a LIST (or Dictionary)

#anylist = ['horse','donkey','zebra','alpaca','elephant','unicorn','giraffe']

#for chickenfeathers in mylist:
	# print(chickenfeathers,'is in the',mylist.index(chickenfeathers))
